Luma represents the achromatic image, while the chroma components represent the color information. Converting R′G′B′ sources (such as the output of a three-{CCD} camera) into luma and chroma allows for chroma subsampling: because human vision has finer spatial sensitivity to luminance ("black and white") differences than chromatic differences, video systems can store and transmit chromatic information at lower resolution, optimizing perceived detail at a particular bandwidth.},

	abstract = {We propose a flexible technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

The scanner sphere probing test describes a method to determine the scanner accuracy, the scanner ball bar test checks the integration of the scanner on the {CMM}. The experimental results show a scanner accuracy of about 8µm (sphere best fit {RMS} value) and a total accuracy below 14µm on a measuring length of 1m.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a performance evaluation test for laser line scanners on 3D coordinate measuring machines ({CMMs}). Laser line scanners are becoming more popular in recent years, mainly for free form inspection tasks and reverse engineering. Error specification of these scanners is difficult because of many influencing factors like surface quality, surface orientation and scan depth. Therefore, procedures for evaluation and verification of conventional contact probes (e.g. touch-trigger probes) are not appropriate for non-contact laser line scanners. A straightforward test method that uses a planar test artefact is proposed. It enables to identify the influence of in-plane and out-of-plane angle, as well as scan depth on systematic and random errors of the laser scanner. Experimental results show that the tested commercial laser scanner, after calibration, exhibits systematic errors of about 10μm.},

Due to registration errors, measurement errors, deformations, etc., a fast and accurate method is important in machine vision measurement. This paper builds a convenient and economic multi-view stereo ({MVS}) measurement system based on a linear stage and a rotary stage to reconstruct the measured object surface completely and accurately. In the proposed technique, the linear stage is used to generate the trigger signal and synchronize the laser sensor scanning; the rotary stage is used to rotate the object and obtain multi-view point cloud data, and then the multi-view point cloud data are registered and integrated into a 3D model. The measurement results show a measurement accuracy of 0.075 mm for a 360° reconstruction in 34 s, and some evaluation experiments were carried out to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the proposed technique.},
