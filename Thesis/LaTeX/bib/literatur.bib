	title = {A Cross-Platform Open Source 3D Object Reconstruction System using a Laser Line Projector},
	abstract = {This paper introduces a cross-platform low-cost system for 3D object reconstruction using a projection-based laser scanner. It uses contact-free measurement techniques for 3D object reconstruction and fast surface registration using Iterative Closest Point ({ICP}) [1]. The only hardware requirements are a simple hand-held laser line projector, a calibration rig and a standard camera. The camera is initially calibrated using Zhang’s camera calibration method so that its external and internal parameters are known. The visible intersection with the known background is used to ﬁnd the 3D pose of the laser plane. This laser plane is used to triangulate new 3D point coordinates of the object’s surface. The point clouds obtained are processed using the "3DTK - The 3D Toolkit" [2] which includes an automatic high-accurate registration process and a fast 3D viewer.},

	abstract = {The advent of aﬀordable consumer grade {RGB}-D cameras has brought about a profound advancement of visual scene reconstruction methods. Both computer graphics and computer vision researchers spend signiﬁcant eﬀort to develop entirely new algorithms to capture comprehensive shape models of static and dynamic scenes with {RGB}-D cameras. This led to signiﬁcant advances of the state of the art along several dimensions. Some methods achieve very high reconstruction detail, despite limited sensor resolution. Others even achieve real-time performance, yet possibly at lower quality. New concepts were developed to capture scenes at larger spatial and temporal extent. Other recent algorithms ﬂank shape reconstruction with concurrent material and lighting estimation, even in general scenes and unconstrained conditions. In this state-of-the-art report, we analyze these recent developments in {RGB}-D scene reconstruction in detail and review essential related work. We explain, compare, and critically analyze the common underlying algorithmic concepts that enabled these recent advancements. Furthermore, we show how algorithms are designed to best exploit the beneﬁts of {RGB}-D data while suppressing their often non-trivial data distortions. In addition, this report identiﬁes and discusses important open research questions and suggests relevant directions for future work.},

	abstract = {We propose a flexible technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

The scanner sphere probing test describes a method to determine the scanner accuracy, the scanner ball bar test checks the integration of the scanner on the {CMM}. The experimental results show a scanner accuracy of about 8µm (sphere best fit {RMS} value) and a total accuracy below 14µm on a measuring length of 1m.},

Due to registration errors, measurement errors, deformations, etc., a fast and accurate method is important in machine vision measurement. This paper builds a convenient and economic multi-view stereo ({MVS}) measurement system based on a linear stage and a rotary stage to reconstruct the measured object surface completely and accurately. In the proposed technique, the linear stage is used to generate the trigger signal and synchronize the laser sensor scanning; the rotary stage is used to rotate the object and obtain multi-view point cloud data, and then the multi-view point cloud data are registered and integrated into a 3D model. The measurement results show a measurement accuracy of 0.075 mm for a 360° reconstruction in 34 s, and some evaluation experiments were carried out to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the proposed technique.},
