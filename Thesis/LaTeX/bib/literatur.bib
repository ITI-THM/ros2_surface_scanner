	abstract = {Abstract The advent of affordable consumer grade RGB-D cameras has brought about a profound advancement of visual scene reconstruction methods. Both computer graphics and computer vision researchers spend significant effort to develop entirely new algorithms to capture comprehensive shape models of static and dynamic scenes with RGB-D cameras. This led to significant advances of the state of the art along several dimensions. Some methods achieve very high reconstruction detail, despite limited sensor resolution. Others even achieve real-time performance, yet possibly at lower quality. New concepts were developed to capture scenes at larger spatial and temporal extent. Other recent algorithms flank shape reconstruction with concurrent material and lighting estimation, even in general scenes and unconstrained conditions. In this state-of-the-art report, we analyze these recent developments in RGB-D scene reconstruction in detail and review essential related work. We explain, compare, and critically analyze the common underlying algorithmic concepts that enabled these recent advancements. Furthermore, we show how algorithms are designed to best exploit the benefits of RGB-D data while suppressing their often non-trivial data distortions. In addition, this report identifies and discusses important open research questions and suggests relevant directions for future work.},

	abstract = {We propose a flexible technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

Recent evolutions improved laser line scanners to the extent that verification is increasingly important. A sphere beam with optically cooperative spheres is proposed as verification object. The ideal verification object excludes many influencing factors, e.g. specular reflection issues. The scanner sphere probing test describes a method to determine the scanner accuracy, the scanner ball bar test checks the integration of the scanner on the {CMM}. The experimental results show a scanner accuracy of about 8µm (sphere best fit {RMS} value) and a total accuracy below 14µm on a measuring length of 1m.},

	abstract = {A new solution to the high-quality 3D reverse modeling problem of complex surfaces for fine workpieces is presented using a laser line-scanning sensor. Due to registration errors, measurement errors, deformations, etc., a fast and accurate method is important in machine vision measurement. This paper builds a convenient and economic multi-view stereo (MVS) measurement system based on a linear stage and a rotary stage to reconstruct the measured object surface completely and accurately. In the proposed technique, the linear stage is used to generate the trigger signal and synchronize the laser sensor scanning; the rotary stage is used to rotate the object and obtain multi-view point cloud data, and then the multi-view point cloud data are registered and integrated into a 3D model. The measurement results show a measurement accuracy of 0.075 mm for a 360&deg; reconstruction in 34 s, and some evaluation experiments were carried out to demonstrate the validity and practicability of the proposed technique.},
