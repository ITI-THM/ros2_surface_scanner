# Entwicklung eines Lasertriangulationssensors zur Oberflächenrekonstruktion mit ROS2

## Abstract

Surface reconstruction is widely used in industry. Be it for inspecting small components, checking larger objects for damage or even surveying entire areas. Laser triangulation is a common method to obtain 3D information of the surface. The present work deals with an open-source developed laser triangulation sensor. This sensor will be used in a research project at the Institut für Technik und Informatik (ITI). The task here is that the sensor generates a three-dimensional image of wooden slices and additionally provides the color information of the surface. In this paper the development and implementation itself, but also the mathematical basics are explained. The results are evaluated and compared with the current standard.
